    2.  6.2.

If you deploy font software in the self-hosting kit that is not Kit Web Font Software, you agree and understand that you are responsible for compliance with any license terms associated with such font software. Monotype shall have no obligation of any kind for any font software used in a self-hosting kit which is not Kit Web Font Software.

You may embed static graphic images into an electronic document, including a Commercial Product, (for example, a “gif”) with a representation of a typeface and typographic design or ornament created with the Desktop Font Software as long as such images are not used as a replacement for Desktop Font Software, (i.e., as long as the representations do not correspond to individual glyphs of the Desktop Font Software and may not be individually addressed by the document to render such designs and ornaments).

1.  You agree that Monotype owns all right, title and interest in and to the Software, its structure, organization, code, and related files, including all property rights therein such as copyright, design and trademarks rights. You agree that the Software, its structure, organization, code, and related files are valuable property of Monotype and that any intentional Use of or access to the Software not expressly permitted by the Agreement constitutes a theft of valuable property.

1.  You agree to use trademarks associated with the Software according to accepted trademark practice, including identification of the trademark owner's name. Trademarks can only be used to identify output produced by the Font Software. The use of any trademark as herein authorized does not give you any rights of ownership in that trademark and all use of any trademark shall inure to the sole benefit of Monotype.

1.  Except as noted in Section 21, the Agreement is governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts applicable to contracts wholly entered and performable within such Commonwealth (without regard to applicable conflict of laws provisions). The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts or, if federal subject matter jurisdiction is lacking, the Superior Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in Middlesex County, shall be the exclusive forum for any disputes arising out of or related to such agreement. Both you and Monotype agree to the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts in any action related to such agreement. The Agreement will not be governed by the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. If any part of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of the balance of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.

1.  This Section 21 only applies to you if you are a “consumer” located in the European Union (as such term is defined and interpreted under the EC Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations (Rome 1980)). This Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted and construed in its entirety in accordance with, the substantive laws in force in the country in which you have your habitual residence and the forum for any disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be the courts competent for the place of your habitual residence. You can withdraw from this Agreement within one (1) month, without giving a reason, in textform (e. g. letter, fax or email), or – in case you receive any goods under this Agreement before that deadline – by returning such goods. The period shall begin after the receipt of these instructions in textform, however not before the day on which you receive the goods and not before the performance of duties to inform, if applicable. To comply with the time limit, it is sufficient to send the withdrawal or the goods in good time. The withdrawal is to be sent using the contact details for Monotype set forth at the bottom of this Agreement. A right of withdrawal may not be exercised if goods have been downloaded, sent to you by email or – in case of a delivery on CD-ROM – the delivered data carrier has been unsealed by you.

1.  If your Account and any applicable fees paid indicate that you have acquired a Paid License through your Plan, your Paid License and this Agreement will be automatically renewed for a subsequent Term, and you will have the option of accepting the renewal of your Paid License and this Agreement for such subsequent Term(s) by paying the fee for each subsequent Term. Monotype reserves the right to adjust the fees associated with any Paid License at any time, however such adjusted fees shall not apply to you until the conclusion of your then-current Term. If you renew the Agreement for subsequent Term(s), you agree that the license fee for the Use of and access to the Software for such subsequent Term(s) may vary from the license fee for the previous Term based upon (a) Monotype’s previous adjustment of the fees associated with such licenses, (b) the length of the renewal Term, (c) the Desktop Font Software to which you request access, and (d) the usage or accessing of the Web Font Software by the Electronic Content. Monotype shall have the right to increase your license fee in respect of a current or renewal Term if your usage exceeds the allowed levels.  If you choose not to renew your Paid License for a subsequent Term, you agree and understand that the terms of this Agreement, including the fees associated with any Paid License, shall no longer apply to you. Any future licensing of any Paid License under this Agreement shall not constitute a revival of this Agreement, and any fees you pay for such future licensing of such product will be at Monotype’s then-current rates. The Term available for you to license any Plan may change in the future.   If your Account indicates that you have acquired a Free License, the Agreement will automatically renew for subsequent one (1) year terms unless the Agreement terminates or you upgrade your license. With a Free License, you agree to place a line of JavaScript on all Electronic Content that Uses or accesses Web Font Software which will enable the Web Font Services. This also gives Monotype the right to invoke an ad unit to be placed on all Electronic Content that uses our Web Font Software, with the formatting and content of such ad unit to be determined by Monotype in its sole discretion. Information regarding applicable license fees can be found on the pages containing the description of each Plan at www.fonts.com//web-fonts.  Such information and plans may be updated from time to time by Monotype in its sole discretion.

1.  Upon failure by you to comply with the terms of this Agreement, Monotype shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement upon notice to you by notification in your Account, regular mail, telefax or email. The termination of the Agreement shall not preclude Monotype from suing you for damages resulting from any breach of the Agreement, and any early termination of this Agreement due to your failure to comply with its provisions and obligations shall not entitle you to a refund of fees paid for the remainder of your Term. Termination of this Agreement shall also constitute termination of the Agreement for any other services provided to you by Monotype that have been linked to your Account. The Agreement may only be modified in writing signed by an authorized officer of Monotype.

1.  You have the rights expressly set forth in the Agreement and no other. All rights in and to the Software, including unpublished rights, are reserved under the copyright laws of the United States and other jurisdictions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any law, statute, treaty, or governmental regulation shall be deemed by a court of competent jurisdiction to provide you with any additional or different rights from those provided herein and such rights shall be deemed non-waiveable as a matter of law and to supersede the rights specifically provided herein, then such law, statute, treaty, or governmental regulation shall be deemed to be made a part of the Agreement. To the extent that any such rights created by any law, statute, treaty or governmental regulation are waiveable, you agree that your acceptance of the Agreement shall constitute an effective and irrevocable waiver of such rights. The Agreement may be enforced by Monotype or by an authorized dealer acting on behalf of Monotype.
